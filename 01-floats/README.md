## CSS: Floats

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

1. Review `example.png`. Your challenge is to replicate this following the steps below.

Other than correcting any validation errors, you **MAY NOT** change any of the HTML.

1. Create a CSS block for `div` which sets the width to 200 pixels, height to 200 pixels and the background color to `rgb(242,87,30)`.

2. Create a CSS block for `section` which sets the width to 600 pixels. Add a 1 pixel, solid border with its color as `#222`. This will help you visualize what is happening as you float each box.

3. Follow the instructions inside `index.html`. The first box should float left, the second one right and the third left.

4. Notice the sections are collapsing. Apply the necessary properties to `section` to fix this.

5. Adjust the margin to provide whitespace between each box and the text next to it.

6. Clear the last paragraph marked with a class of `clear-me` so it begins on a new line, after the box. You may want to adjust the whitespace so the text is not up against the box.

**BONUS:** If you notice, text dips below the top of each box. This is a design sin; the text and box should be aligned (as seen in `better-alignment.png`). Write a new CSS block which uses a box model property to fix this.

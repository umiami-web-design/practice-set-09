### Download this Repository

You can download this repository by clicking the green 'Code' button and selecting 'Open with GitHub Desktop'.

### Files

Once this repository has been cloned (downloaded) to your computer, you should have the following files within the `practice-set-08` directory on your computer:

- README.md (this file)
- 01-floats
- 02-positioning
- 03-sebastians-resume

(Exercise 03 is cumulative and creative. This isn't necessary for understanding the concepts, but it gives you an opportunity to apply what you have learned in a way that's more practical.)

Do not create or move any files outside of the `practice-set-08` directory for this exercise!

### Instructions

Instructions for each exercise are included in their respective folder.


### Tips

- **Read the instructions** before beginning work. Understand what you are trying to accomplish before you write one piece of code.

- **Complete one task at a time.** Do not jump ahead. These steps are designed to help you develop a routine for creating a document structure.

- **Keep a checklist.** After you finish a task, check it off. If you need to set the practice aside, you'll know what step to come back to.

- **Track your questions.** If there's something you are unsure of, make a note to yourself in a notebook or using comments in your code. We can address these in class.

- **Be patient.** If you run into a difficult task, try working through the problem. It is okay to take your time. Refer to your notes or book. (Be careful about random sources on the Internet; they may give you bad information.)


### Solution

A solution (plus a copy of these files for future practice) for this exercise will be posted by Monday, Oct. 19.

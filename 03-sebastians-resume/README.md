## CSS: Sebastian's Resume

### Instructions

This is another creative exercise which allows you to apply all the knowledge you've accumulated.

Make sure the HTML is valid before proceeding. Make sure the image works. Never assume I will give you "clean" code in any exercise moving forward! }:-)

In this directory is `resume.html`, which marks up Sebastian the Ibis' resume. Review `resume.png` in the `example` directory. Your task is to style the HTML so it matches the example provided.

It's very possible your code may be different from what was used to create this design. A few hints to come up with a solution which mirrors mine (and gives you practice with certain properties):

- The address and dates which are on the right side have been moved using positioning.
- There are two! different approaches which can be applied to the list items under Qualities. :)
- Box model properties have been used to create whitespace within the gray boxes.
- Whitespace is applied using 16px, but in some cases may be applied using 24px or 8px (for balance).
- Not sure about colors? Use one of the tools I shared in class. :)

Once you meet the basic solution, again, **play!!!**. Have some **fun** with this!
